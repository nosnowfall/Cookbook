    \end{headnotes}

    \begin{directions}[For the fish:]
        \item Make sure your fish is thawed well in advance. Whisk together the miso, mirin, and sesame oil. With a sharp knife, make hash marks into the fish, then swish the fillets around in the marinade until fully coated. Cover and refrigerate at least 2 hours, but up to 12.
        \item Heat a skillet over medium-high heat, then add the neutral oil and fish. If it sizzles intensely, reduce the heat to avoid burning the marinade.
        \item Cook for about 4 minutes on the first side, until it is lightly golden. Reduce heat further if necessary to prevent burning. Flip and cook for another 2 minutes or so, until the center is just cooked.
        \item Serve with rice or other grain and veggies on the side.
    \end{directions}
    \begin{directions}[For the mushrooms:]
        \item Whisk together miso and sake. Slice all mushrooms into bite-sized pieces. 
        \item Cut a 14 by 12-inch piece of foil and spread 2 tsp butter across one side. Place the onions on the foil, followed by the mushrooms, with bigger pieces on top. Drizzle the miso over the musrooms and place the remaining butter on top.
        \item Fold up the foil edges and close tightly into a packet, so that steam will not escape. Bake in the oven at 425$^{\circ}$ F for 18-20 minutes. Serve with a sprinkling of soy sauce and chives.
    \end{directions}
